STEPS BY STEPS:  
How would you write a function(s) where you have:
    - An array of tags (keywords from paragraphs)
    - A search query (as String)
    - Returns the most relevant tags inside that list (Or null if none matches)

STEP 1: Create a function called search.
STEP 2: Write a if statement.
STEP 3: Inside the if statement compare they keywords to inputed keyword by the user.
STEP 4: If inputed keyword matched the keywords, prompt match found else no match found.
STEP 5: Display the result.
